# Simple Gender Classifier with Keras Naive Bayes Algortihm

## Requirements
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Jupyter Notebook (Optional)
### I recommend using Anaconda distribution as it is equipped with everything.

## How to use
- Clone the repository
'''git clone url'''
- Run the juypter notebook file.
- Import and run the find_gender method.

## Method.
- Feature extraction from the text using count vectorizer.

## Notes
This is a relatively simple classifier with less than 100k of training data.
You can use bigger dataset or custom feature extraction to improve accuracy.
